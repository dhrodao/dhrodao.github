    <h1 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h1>

<p>For this project I have used CV2 in Phyton for image processing and different logic methods for robots, the robot used has a camera in the front side of the drone (the black one). The objective is that the black drone (cat) needs to follow the red one (mouse) in an open field map.</p>

<h1 id="2-image-processing">2. Image processing</h1>

<p>First of all I needed to proccess the image that i was getting from the front camera. After converting the image into HSV I used a color space in where the green color is not passing the filter and then I got the contours from it (using the findContours() method from cv2). With the contour array I get the areas and then I keep the biggest one (that is suposed to be the drone) and calculate the X and Y errors. This is the processed image:</p>

<h1 id="3-following-method">3. Following method</h1>

<p>I applied a case-based method in order to follow the “cat”, setting the movement speed experimentally. The first try, I implemented an algorithm that the drone was moving based on the area it calculated on the red one, but this area was too small and the drone was very slow so I needed to improve it. This is an example execution of the algorithm:</p>

<p>I improved the algorithm considering many cases with the area value. And I got this result:</p>

<p>As you can appreciate in the last video, the drones had a collision so I adjusted some parameters in order the drones don’t collide. So this is the third version of my exercise with a total of 397.0 points:</p>

<p>As one of my last versions I made some changes to the proyect in order to avoid some random collisions and to get a faster drone. I considered the center view on axis Y for my drone a bit lower than I would be on a real perception of the frame with the intention that the drone always is on a higher plane than the red one. Also configured some cases having in account the error, raising or lowering the drone speed and, if needed, gets the drone stopped. This is the fourth version of my exercise, raising a total of 930.0 points:</p>

<p>For the last implementantion, as my drone was a bit <em> reckless </em> I decided to implement a PID controller in order it is more stable and it dont shock with -the cat- in the mayority of situations. This is the las version test of my exercise:</p>
