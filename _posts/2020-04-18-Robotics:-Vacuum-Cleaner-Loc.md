# 1. Introduction
The objective of this exercise is to program the intelligence of a vacuum cleaner in order it autolocates in a house (with the given map). The map is a binary image, and you need to process it to abstract information. The objective is to cover the largest area of the house using the auto location algorithm.

# 2. Hardware
The vacuum cleaner is equipped with:
<ul>
  <li>A pair of motors for moving</li>
  <li>Laser</li>
</ul>
I did not use the laser in order to solve the exercise.

# 3. Conversion of types
In order to get the 3d coordinates from Gazebo equivalent to our map we need to apply an scale, in my case I resized the image to 500x500px and stablished a scale of 50px per meter. The matrix for conversion of types is the following:

With this conversion of types we can stablish the position of the vacuum on the gazebo scenario.

# 4. Route planification
In order to calculate the route of the vacuum it will be needed a navigation mesh applied on the house map. The dimension for the cells should be the dimension of the vacuum (16x16px) in order to cover every zone of the house map. 
The map will be used for checking the paths where the vacuum has passed on. Using the cv2 method for erosion we get the obstacles dilated a bit and this is a good point in order the vacuum doesn't hit any obstacle.
Firstly, we need to calculate the cells in wich the vacuum is. And traduce this coordinates to pixels on the map. Once we get the position on the map and created the first cell, it will be calculated adjacent cells to it (on North, South, East and West). The cells could be on one of three values:
<ul>
  <li>Obstacle: At least one of the pixels of the cell is black</li>
  <li>Virtual obstacle: The vacuum has already passed by this cell before</li>
  <li>Free: Every pixel on the cell is white</li>
</ul>
We will need tho check every close cell and check its value. 
With a specific method we will calculate the next cell the vacuum needs to move.

# 5. Return route
If our vacuum reaches to a critical point and it's surrounded of obstacles it wont be able to calculate the route to move to another cell. We will need to implement a method to check if each cell the vacuum is in order if it's a critical point or not.
The return will be calculated with the saved path that the vacuum has travelled.

# 6. Vacuum driving
Once calculated the next move, we need to calculate the deviation that exists from our cell to the target. We need to convert our coordinates from absolute to the relatives to the robot.
The velocity and the steering will be determined depending of the situation.

# 7. Visual example
As first version I used a 20px size for the vacuum because using the real size I was getting an error and the vacuum deviated too much and it was loosing the path it must follow. So I tested and using a bigger size and it found correctly. Here is the visual example:


As my second version, I focused on fixing the issue I got with the px size of the vacuum. So I fixed it (the issue came from the map information abstraction) and updated every variable related with the vacuum size:
<pre>
  self.VACUUM_PX_SIZE = 16
  self.VACUUM_PX_HALF = 8
</pre>
Also, on the previous version, as the size I defined was a bit bigger, the hole surface wasn't covered, there were some thiny spaces between each sweep. So, considering 16px as size this was also fixed besause the distance from each sweep must be close to 0 (many times it is less than 0) and it covers almost the entire surface:


On this version I also added more speed for the vacuum, calculated from the 90ยบ laser distance (if distance is more than 3 cells full speed, if distance is less than 3 cells but higher than 1 medium speed and if its closer the speed is the minumum in order the vacuum cleaner don't get smacked into the wall. This is the visual example:
